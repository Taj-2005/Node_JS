# Advanced Programming (CSA213) – Coding Notes  

This repository contains my coding notes, examples, and exercises for the **Advanced Programming** course (CSA213) at Rishihood University, offered in **Semester 3 (2025–26)** under the **B.Tech. CS & AI / CS & DS** program.  

---

## 📘 Course Overview  
The course focuses on **backend development using Node.js**, covering:  
- RESTful API design  
- Database interaction with SQL & Prisma ORM  
- Authentication & authorization (JWT, RBAC)  
- Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)  
- Deployment & environment management  

By the end of the course, students will be able to **design, implement, and deploy secure, scalable backend systems**.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
Before diving into the notes and code here, you should be comfortable with:  
- **JavaScript Fundamentals** (variables, loops, functions, ES6+)  
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** (callbacks, promises, async/await)  
- **Basic HTML & HTTP concepts**  
- **Command line basics** (npm, scripts, terminal usage)  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
1. **Understand**  
   - Client-server architecture, HTTP, event loop  
   - REST principles, database concepts, ORM basics  

2. **Apply**  
   - Node.js modules & Express.js framework  
   - Prisma ORM for CRUD & migrations  
   - JWT for authentication & middleware  

3. **Analyze**  
   - Performance bottlenecks in async code  
   - Security vulnerabilities in APIs  
   - Database schema optimization  

4. **Evaluate**  
   - REST API designs & authentication strategies  
   - Code modularity, maintainability, and scalability  

5. **Create**  
   - RESTful APIs integrated with databases  
   - Secure authentication/authorization flows  
   - Deployment-ready Node.js backend projects
